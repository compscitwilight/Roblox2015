# Roblox 2015 Website Clone
### Description
This is a remake/clone of the Roblox 2015 website, please note that all assets that belong to Roblox Corporation are theirs, I do not own them.

### Purpose of this project
The purpose of this project is to simply bring back the 2015 website the way that the Wayback Machine cannot. This project is fully equipped with registration, login, APIs, and everything else needed to make a functional and nostalgic website (besides databases atm).

### Legal
Assets belonging to Roblox Corporation are fully theirs, I do not take ownership as this is an open-source website simply meant for nostalgic reasons. 

### Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the project to make it even closer to the original 2015 website, please <a href="https://github.com/devrusty/Roblox2015Clone/compare">create a pull request</a>. Also, please make sure that you include some sort of proof that this was actually on the 2015 website (screenshot, video, Wayback Machine snapshot, etc). Please also list all of the changes you've made.
